In 2019 I was graduated from the mumbai university in Mechanical Engineering. 
After the end of college,
 I joined the company where I was working as service Engineer for 1 year,
then after that i got offer for MNC company in my field i did that for 1 year,
 After  that i resign my job, because i was not satisfied with my work.
 I have always been passionate about coding but in the four years of engineering, 
I never do any coding,beacause i taught coding was boring but deep down i know that 
i was quite passionate about coding because my friend were working in coding sector.
I heard about Masai School from many of my friends and 
I was impressed with the pay after when you get the job.
 Then I decided to join Masai School.
That how i enroll with masai and their skills regarding coding also placement percentage .
